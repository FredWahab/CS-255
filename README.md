# CS-255
A collection of work I have done for CS-255 at Southern New Hampshire University.

8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission
The DriverPass project is designed for a small driving school to have an online presence and allow customers to schedule sessions, take online tests, and make payments. The design of the system began with the creation of the business requirements document (brd) using the provided template. There I addressed the goals of the company, the resourceses needed to implemnent it, and anticipated some of the limitations and security concerns that would arise. I think I did particullarly well in using LucidChart to develop a number of different diagrams including a use case uml diagram, a class uml diagram, a sequence diagram, and a couple of activity diagrams. I felt like these were clear in providing an understanding of the activities and componenets they represented. Finally, I brought it all together in project 2 with the system design document and the design power point presentation. If I was going to revise anything, it would be the power point presentation. I would have added and removed slides from the template for an actual audience to more accurately deliver the information. My approach to designing software revolves around the user experience. What do they expcect the system to do and what can I build to anticipate needs not yet realized.
